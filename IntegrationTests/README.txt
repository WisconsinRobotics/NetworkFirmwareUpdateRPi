An automated image-based verification test covering the entire front-end. Guarantees that any changes to out code won’t affect the functionality of our web application. The test outputs feedback for each individual unit, and if a unit fails, the test will indicate what failed. It tests the process start to finish, from setting up the server to validating that an image is transferred to the appropriate location.
